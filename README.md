# CityDAO NFT Museum

> CityDAO is like a city, and cities have museums. Since CityDAO is like a crypto city, we have a museum of NFTs. This is the open-source code-base. **If you are interested in showing your art, or requesting events, such as virtual art parties, please upvote [this dework community suggestion](https://app.dework.xyz/citydao/engineering-2/community?taskId=278aeddc-c53d-4b89-ac8c-f0f60a315032).**
